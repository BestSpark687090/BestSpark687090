    <!-- Hi there! If you're looking at the HTML and wondering why the word HTML is in a tag called htextml, it's because since HTML is taken, i use htextml to make the word HTML to have the color of the HTML logo. -->
    <p>
      I program in <js>JS</js> mostly, with a <small>small</small> bit of
      knowledge in <htextml>HTML</htextml> and <css> CSS</css>, but just enough
      to make this site!
    </p>
    <p>
      I usually use <node>Node</node>.<js>JS</js> to program, but sometimes I
      use regular <js>JS</js> to make things like <this>this</this>!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to check out my <node>Node</node>.<js>JS</js> programs, click
      <a

        target="_blank"
        >here</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to check out my regular <js>JS</js> programs, but in bookmark
      form, click

        >here</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made 2 good <discord>Discord</discord> bots using
      <discord>Discord</discord>.<js>JS</js>, one for some tests, and one for my
      friends to play a game with!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also made a game based on a friend's idea with
      <htextml>HTML</htextml>, <js>JS</js>, and <css>CSS</css> called Krabby
      Patty Clicker.
