  <!-- Hi there! If you're looking at the HTML and wondering why the word HTML is in a tag called htextml, it's because since HTML is taken, i use htextml to make the word HTML to have the color of the HTML logo. -->
  <p>I program in <js>JS</js> mostly, with a <small>small</small> bit of knowledge in <htextml>HTML</htextml> and <css>
      CSS</css>, but just enough to make this site!</p>
  <p>I usually use <node>Node</node>.<js>JS</js> to program, but sometimes I use regular <js>JS</js> to make things like
    <this>this</this>!
  </p>
  <p>If you want to check out my <node>Node</node>.<js>JS</js> programs, click <a
      href="https://github.com/BestSpark687090/Visual-Studio-Code-Projects" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  <p>If you want to check out my regular <js>JS</js> programs, but in bookmark form, click <a
      href="https://github.com/SparkTricks/SchoolBookmarks" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  <p>I have made 2 good <discord>Discord</discord> bots using <discord>Discord</discord>.<js>JS</js>, one for some
    tests, and one for my friends to play a game with!</p>
  <p>I have also made a game based on a friend's idea with <htextml>HTML</htextml>, <js>JS</js>, and <css>CSS</css>
    called Krabby Patty Clicker.</p>
  <!-- <p><b>UPDATE:</b> The code has been found, and you can now play it in Replit!</p> -->
  <p>If you want to play it, you can play it <a href="https://krabbypattyclicker.bestspark687090.repl.co"
      target="blank">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Also, I have made a listing of all of my games I have made.</p>
