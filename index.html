<!-- for lua compile
oh and if you DO that make sure to keep the website private because
piracy and stuff is bad, obviously 
(oh btw if you wanna do balatro me, take note of above i guess)
https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=95820 
also what if i put the balatro shader somewhere
i also need to get some of the variables right tbh cause
vortex speed wasnt right the first time it was a lil too fast i think
that may be because of like no fps constraints or smthn
