# BestSpark687090

Hey there, I'm BestSpark687090, or you can just call me BestSpark. I like developing games, and I really enjoy it.

I'm interested in many programming languages, such as Lua, JavaScript, HTML, and others.

anyways this is also a website for games, here's a link to them:

main: https://bestspark.onrender.com

now you may be wondering why i made alternatives.

there is a little problem where they all link to the same onrender sites, but the other games part of the site _will_ work fine.

alternate _2_: https://bestspark.pages.dev/

alternate _3_: https://bestspark.netlify.app/

alternate _4_: https://bestspark.replit.app
(this one may not be updated as well since i have to manually push republish on replit)
